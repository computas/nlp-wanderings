The South Viking Graben has an asymmetrical profile bounded in the west by the Brea/Crawford Fault Zone and the Utsira High to the east. The Jotun Field is sitting on a basement terrace stepping up to the Utsira High from the Graben area.\n2577-45 (Hermod South Prospect) is a stratigraphic prospect comprising of basin floor turbidite sands of the Paleocene Hermod Formation. Top, bottom and side seal is provided by the coeval Sele Formation mudstones with the updip pinchout of the the turbidite controlled by onlap onto a basin floor high (Utsira High).\nThe 25/7-1 well which was drilled in 1986 for a Jurassic target encountered oil shows in thin ratty sands in the Paleocene (later biostratigraphic analysis placed these sands as Hermod age) Seismic attribute extraction of the Hermod interval indicated a reflection intensity (amplitude) anomaly which developed away from the 25/7-1 well.\nRegional geology predicted that sands could extend out into this part of the basin at Hermod times and that this area may provide a focus for deposition as the turbidites lose energy against the Utsira High. The prospect model developed as a basin floor fan sand encased in coeval shale with the presence of oil shows in the nearby well as direct evidence for source (or indeed an OWC) Seismic modelling proved that the anomaly seen could be generated by a thicker sand package – but it would be difficult to distinguish between oil and water. The anomaly was not indicative of a gas accumulation. The critical uncertainty was seen as the updip seal against the Utsira High – there was significant risk that hydrocarbons may have leaked up onto the Utsira High to the Balder Field.\nOperations began when the semisubmersible drilling rig Maersk Jutlander was picked up on 28th May 1997. Well 25/7-4S was spudded on 2nd June. The well was drilled vertical to a total depth of 2560m MD (2546m TVD) RKB, into the Cretaceous. Wireline logging at TD consisted of GR/DSI/DIT-E, VSP and CST. The well was permanently plugged and abandoned and the rig was released at the 25/7-4S location on 21th July 1997 at 05:00 hrs.\nGood quality Hermod sands were encountered at 2018m MD (-1987m TVD SS). However, no indications of hydrocarbons were found. No core was cut in the Heimdal Formation, and the well was plugged without testing.\nThe AFE estimated time for the well was 27.7 days dry hole including 3 days coring. Actual estimated drilling time was 23.7 days.\nDocumenti\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 2\nGEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS\n2.1 OBJECTIVES AND RISK\nThe exploration well 25/7-4S was drilled to test the 25/7 Hermod South prospect, a stratigraphic trap comprising of channelised basin floor sandstones of the Paleocene Hermod Formation.\nThe primary objectives of the well are:\n•\nTo test the presence of hydrocarbons in the Hermod South prospect by drilling, coring, logging and testing the primary objective Hermod Sandstone.\n•\nEstablish hydrocarbon type(s) and fluid contacts (if present).\n•\nEvaluate the Lower Tertiary interval by ensuring that the well penetrates the Cretaceous.\nThe well was drilled as planned to a total depth of 2560 m MD RKB (2546 m TVD RKB), 10m into the Cretaceous.\nSource was considered to be a low risk for this prospect - it is close to proven oil fields (Balder, Jotun), and the 25/7-1 well had oil shows in thin Hermod sands. Although the reservoir was water wet it is not believed that lack of source was the reason (see below). Some evidence of residual shows was seen on the LWD resistivity log.\nIntegration of regional geology with seismic modelling indicated the potential for thicker Hermod reservoir potential in this area. An increase in reflection intensity seemed to correspond to an increased Hermod isopach thickness indicating thicker sand with differen-tial compaction effects. When encountered in the area, Hermod sand has been of good quality >25% porosity. The model of reservoir thickening in this area was proved to be valid . Over 100m of excellent reservoir sand was encountered with porosity 30 – 35% and N:G > 90%.\nThe Hermod South prospect was mapped as a stratigraphic trap comprising of isolated Paleocene Hermod sands sealed by coeval shales of the Sele Formation. Recent 3-D seismic data was used to map the prospect. The reservoir interval could be mapped seismically including the lateral pinchout. Some risk was attached to the mapping of the updip pinchout of the sands against the Utsira high.\nThe mapping of the prospect proved to be very accurate, encountering good reservoir very close to the predicted depth. With the well control and the results of this well it is clear that the amplitude anomaly is consistent with thick sand.\nContainment was viewed as the critical risk – in particular the updip seal against the Utsira High. The main risk was that leakage updip would allow hydrocarbons up into the Balder complex. The downdip well location imposed by the open acreage) was recognised as\nDocumenti\nFile code: 2577-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 2\nGEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS\npossibly not answering this uncertainty since economic volumes of hydrocarbons could still be trapped updip of the well location. The reservoir was water wet and so it is probable that the updip seal failed.\n2.2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING\nBlock 25/7 is situated in the South Viking Graben on the western side of the Utsira High, a basement high that tilts slightly towards the east. The South Viking Graben has an asymmetrical profile bounded in the west by the Brea/Crawford Fault Zone and the Utsira High to the east. The Jotun Field is sitting on a basement terrace stepping up to the Utsira High from the Graben area (see Figure 1 for well location).\nThe South Viking Graben was formed by major east-west extension during Late Permian to Early Triassic and Middle to Late Jurassic. The latter rifting phase with footwall uplift and subsequent erosion resulted in deposition of sands, clay and conglomerates along the westem flank of the Utsira High and the eastern flank of the East Shetland Platform.\nTwo periods with significant tectonic uplift occurred in the North Sea. The first occurred in the Middle Jurassic and was centered around the Witch Graben, South Viking Graben and Central Graben triple junction. The second period of tectonic uplift started in the Latest Cretaceous and continued into the Palaeocene and Early Eocene and was centred in the Irish Sea and the East Shetland platform areas.\nDuring this last tectonic phase eastward prograding deltaic complexes fed the South Viking Graben with high density turbidites and debris flows principally during lowstand periods.\n2.3 SAMPLING\n2.3.1 Routine Sampling\nWell 25/7-4S was drilled riserless with returns to seabed to a depth of 1188 m MD (13-3/8\" casing shoe). Consequently, sampling did not commence until drilling the 12-1/4\" section. A total of eight routine sample sets were collected:\nDocument]\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 2\nGEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS\nTable 1: Cuttings distribution.

The source was positioned 3.5m below MSL and operated at an air-pressure of 130 bars. The gun offset was 41m and the gun azimuth was 269 degrees. The receiver array consisted of a main tool and three satellites, each containing a 3-component geophone cartridge. Thus four levels were acquired simultaneously.\nA total of 71 levels were recorded. Seven of these were excluded from the check shot report due to unreliable first time breaks. All levels were included in the Zero Offset VSP processing\nDocument]\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 2\nGEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS\nA summary of the levels (in MD RKB) acquired for the Zero Offset VSP:\nFrom: 2260m 2100m 2020m 1620m\nTo: 2100m 2020m 1620m 493m\nSpacing: 10m 20m 10m variable\nUnfortunately the logging tool stopped at 2260 on the way down, and the operators were not able to get it below this point. More details regarding the acquisition and processing of the VSP data can be found in the VSP report made by Read Well Services.\nThe final data are of good quality in the cased hole section (from 1930 to 1560m RKB), and not so good in the open hole section (2260 to 1940m RKB), see figure 2.\nWell 25/7-4S largely confirmed the seismic interpretation as presented in the Drilling Program. Slightly lower velocities than predicted were observed in the well, which resulted in the main horizons coming in shallower than the prognosed depths. The exception was Top Heimdal which was approximately at prognosis, but had probably been picked slightly too high on the seismic. The formations below 2260 will not have direct check shot calibration, since the tool did not reach TD.\nGenerally the tie between the VSP and the seismic improves by shifting the seismic approximately 10ms down. This seems to be the case for the other wells which ties this survey too, and indicated that a too small timeshift has been applied in the well matching of the survey\nTable 6 shows the prognosed vs. actual time/depth relationships for the main horizons.\nG: GROUP DRILLING\\FWR125-7-45125745new.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 09.12.97\nLEVEL NO.\n1.4\nMETERS OFFSET RECEIVER\nTIME TVD (M) BELOW KB BELOW KB DEPTH (M) MEASURED FIRST BREAK (MS)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSS\n-\nHorizontal scale 1: 1000 Receiver offset\nWELL: 25/7-4S.

However, the chromatograph had been reading C1 to nÇ4 in the whole well. In most cases the readings show about the same level of C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. The hromatograph showed too high values and often higher values of iC4 and nC4 than C2 and C3. This can not be correct, as with zero Total gas one would expect the chromatograph to show only very low values of C1 and C2, but normally no C3 to nC4.

No evidence of gas was seen during the drilling operation.\nThe Site Survey for the well was carried out as a part of a larger Semi-regional Site Survey by Britsurvey, a division of Svitzer Limited. This was acquired using the vessel M.V. \"Svitzer Magellan\" during the period, 16th January- 16\" February 1997.\nThe survey covered an area of approximately 13 x 4 kilometres and consisted of 182.8 line kilometres of HR Digital Seismic lines with maximum 500m spacing and 318.6 kilometres of analogue (sidescan sonar, multibeam echosounder, Bentech subbottom profiler, single channel airgun) with 250m line spacing. The HR seismic was acquired in intergrated mode together with analogue survey data.\nThe CN25-93 3D seismic dataset was also used and integrated into the shallow geological interpretation.\nTop Skade formation was considered when determining the casing point for the surface casing string, as it was expected to be a weaker sandy formation and was to be avoided with the casing shoe. This was expected to a poorly developed sand and was thus difficult to predict from the site survey data although it was prognosed and found to be well above the planned 13-3/8\" casing shoe.\nA 36\" hole was drilled to 231 metres RKB and 30\" casing set at 226 metres RKB. A 17-1/2\" hole was then drilled to 1190 metres RKB and 13-3/8\" casing set at 1188 metres RKB. No pilot hole was drilled on this well due to the lack of shallow gas indicators from the Site Survey and absence of any indications of gas in the nearby 25/7-1, 25/7-2 and 25/7-3 wells.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-4S B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 09.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 2\nGEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS\nWELL DATA:\nDistance from rig floor to sea level:\n23 metres\nWater depth (MSL):\n126 metres\nSetting depth for conductor (m RKB):\n226 metres\nLeak Off / Formation Integrity Test (g/cc):\nSetting depth for casing on which BOP is mounted (m RKB): 1188 metres\nLOT / FIT (g/cc):\n1.90\nDepth (m RKB) & two way time to formation/section/layer tops:\nUtsira (data available from well in shallow section) 490 metres Hordaland Group\n923 metres Skade Formation\n972 metres\n510 ms 942 ms 1013 ms\nDepth interval (m RKB & TWT) and age of sand bodies shallower than 1000 m under the seabed.

Procurement of drilling time with the Jutlander was possible through a negotiated trade of options in our two year Jutlander contract (beginning in December 1998).\nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES - Third party services, which were “rig-up intensive”, were farmed in along with the drilling unit. Bidding and preparation of third party services by Norske Conoco AS was initiated in September 1996 with the objective that a full set of contracts would be in place to accommodate the 1997 drilling program. Major NCAS service contract which were used include; Drilling Fluids, MWD Services, Coring, Casing, Wellheads, Surveying, and Rental Tools. Services farmed in with the rig included; Cementing, Mud Logging, ROV, Directional Drilling, Electric Logging, and Well Testing (although no test was conducted).\n3.1.2\nOperations Planning\nWell planning for two exploration wells plus the associated ACD was initiated approximately 3 1/2 months prior to spud of the first well: 25/7-4S was the first well and 650717-11$ the second. Back-to-back planning was effective because many of the work processes were applicable to both wells and the need for “re-engineering” was minimized.\nAn OIM from the Jutlander was in Conoco's office for approximately 8 weeks to provide operational support for the well planning and ACD processes. This was mutually beneficial because planning was conducted with full consideration of the rig and work process conditions. This was mutually beneficial because it allowed a closer working relationship between Conoco and the Contractor.\nTwo Drilling Supervisors which had been working the Jutlander were contracted as Lead Supervisors (one from BP and one consultant).\nAll four drilling supervisors went through a training program designed by the NCAS Human Resources Group to learn Conoco specific requirements and procedures, and also to meet key personnel within the NCAS office.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-4812574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-4S B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.1.3 Well Test Planning\nWell test preparations were initiated prior to spud to ensure there would be no delay in the event of a DST. Equipment was already in place on the Jutlander but it was not DNV certified. Inspections and upgrades to allow certification and expeditious testing were conducted including emergency shut-down panels, spill containment combing, insulation of lines, painting and marking of lines.\nA preliminary well test program and AFE were also prepared by an EPT Test Engineer. This pre-work, including the Program and AFE, is not included in this document. Reference drilling file DEW.103.25/7-4S.B51.01.\n3.1.4\nSafety and Environment\nAlthough Maersk Jutlander's historical safety performance had been poor (H-value of 18 by February, when NCAS' pre-planning and active involvement started), considerable improvements were gradually noted throughout the operations, and the HSE goals for the campaign were achieved by a status of zero recordable accidents for 25/7-4S drilling period.\nHSE awareness on the rig was raised as measured by a clear increase in quantity and quality of reported unsafe acts/conditions during NCAS' campaign. Reporting of Events was raised from 33 reports in May, to 78 reports in June.\nContractors' safety awareness / performance was enhanced through early influence/cooperation with Maersk / BP / Shell, a dedicated pre-spud safety meeting, NCAS' Safety Program (supplemental), and NCAS' demonstrated concern regarding HSE issues.\nThe safety initiatives program with small gifts for reporting of unsafe acts/conditions, and also for suggestioned efficiency improves, worked well. The \"blind“ draws for prizes at the Safety Meetings seemed to increase the interest level. However, the NCAS and Contractor personnel need to inject some additional effort / spirit into this part of the overall safety program.\nThe surprise gift after this accident free well (chairs for the cabins) arrived late, but was well received onboard.\nMaersk's assigned role as Principal Enterprise was not particularly visible, but was gradually promoted. The Working Environment Mapping appeared to be a lengthy process, but was gradually receiving more attention.\nThe communication between the rig's Medic and NCAS Company Doctor worked well, but the Company Doctor's involvement in the operations planning phase could be more direct and visible in future planning processes\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-4S B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nEarly meetings with the Drilling Contractor aided in better understanding of their HSE/QA system, as an important supporting supplement to NCAS's own system.\nUse of existing documentation (e.g.: Drilling Contractor's Operations Manuals, Safety Case, Audit / Inspection Reports, Accident / Incident Reporting Forms,...) worked well. This limits potential confusion by not imposing new or temporarily practices and document formats, validates work done and minimizes the need for re-doing paperwork of limited value for operations.\nAudits and inspections were focused on critical areas or perceived gaps. This minimized duplication of effort and minimized negative affects on Maersk management/personnel.\nSeparate Compliance Meetings and HSE Meetings worked better than the earlier combined meetings, fostered good/common attitudes to handle compliance issues, clarified responsibilities and emphasized Maersk's role as Principal Enterprise.\nMaersk's involvement in the execution of the HAZOP during the planning phase and Safety Delegate participation was positive.\nOperations were conducted within the regulatory provisions set by the SFT, and no reportable spills/discharges were noted. Spot-checks identified a problem with raised oil content in bilge water, but this was rectified by new maintenance routines for the oily water separator.\nThe waste handling onboard MJ gradually improved, and is now much better since all crews have now been trained by; Shell, BP and NCAS.\nThe use of existing documentation (the Environmental Vulnerability Study from Amerada Hess) worked well, and our assessment approach should be continued for future campaigns.\nThe existing approach for emergency preparedness assessment, including manual review, 1/2 day analysis/assessment session, and 1/2 day Table Top, works OK. One should continue to actively involve key contractors in these emergency preparedness reviews. NCAS' system appeared capable to handle possible emergency situations.\nNCAS’s firm attitude to prioritize correction of regulatory shortcomings resulted in good improvements in this area.\nThe close cooperation and effort made to actively involve the Drilling Contractor in typical Operator-related activities had a positive impact on communication and training. This also supports the aims of the legislation and industry to gradually make the Drilling Contractors more accountable.\nG:\\GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-4812574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-4S B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.1.5 Equipment and Inspections\nA.\nDRILL STRING - Existing inspection programs were continued for all Contractor supplied drill string components. This was based on a Shell Standard which was implemented jointly by BP and Shell. Under this program the drill string was inspected every 2000 hours and the BHA components where inspected every 300 hours.\nBOP - A third party inspector (West-Hou) was commissioned to inspect the BOP equipment. This was beneficial although time limitations restricted the process. This continues to be an area where it is possible to effect the over-all degree of safety and preparedness and should be considered for future operations.\nRENTAL AND VENDOR SUPPLIED COMPONENTS . The inspection criteria for vendor supplied equipment was DS-1 (Level 4) from T.H. Hill. This proved to be a good process and a more recognized standard than the previously used DEQS (Drilling Equipment Qualification Standard).\n3.1.6\nInformation Management\nThis is the first time that NCAS has used the DIMS drilling database system. Although the system could be quite good and user friendly, this version had quite a few bugs and it created havoc in the reporting at times. Some work is still needed to perfect this system and make a good database.\nLarger “surge suppressors” should be used to protect the computers, there were “surges” on the MJ ( value unknown ) which caused problems with computer operations. The surges appeared whenever the drawworks was clutched during tripping operations. An additional telephone line would also be useful to allow a dedicated fax line.\nIt would be useful to have a CD drive installed on the rig PC (allow access to product catalogs provided on CD). The rig computer should be loaded with Wellplan, DIMS, a time planner, Hydraulics program, spreadsheet and word processor such as Microsoft or Smartsuit. It would be useful to have previous wells loaded on the rig PC (in DIMS). This is useful for forecasting expected progress.\nEffective organization of hard copy materials is equally as critical as electronic data management. Organization of well and equipment files should be formalized prior to start-up.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.1.7 Application for Consent to Drill (ACD)\nAn ACD Look-back meeting was performed on 21 August to summarize lessons learned from the ACD process, from which the following conclusions were made.\nAlthough the ACD process is manpower intensive and there are some areas for further improvement, our ACD process has been refined and is generally considered to represent a best practice. Besides obtaining the Authorities formal concurrence for commencement of operations, the approach ensures that HSE aspects and regulatory compliance are systematically managed and integrated throughout operations.\nThe objective of effectively integrating the ACD process with other drilling preparations is considered successfully achieved, and this supports the inter-discipline cooperation and recognition of common goals for the operations.\nThe process was presented in a meeting with the NPD, and a positive response was obtained. The success by obtaining NPD's confidence is measured by open/informal communication with the personnel in the NPD's Safety & Working Environment Division, the general support and concurrence to our requested exemptions, no regulatory orders and by no ad-hoc NPD rig inspections/audits during our drilling campaign.\nThe process was well responded to by Mærsk Contractors Norge AS, who have recommended a similar approach to their other clients.\nThe close cooperation and efforts made to actively involve the Drilling Contractor in typical Operator-related activities are positive for communication and training purposes. This also supports the aims of the legislation and industry to gradually make the Contractors more accountable.\nThe NCAS approach is recognized and now being used as a model for development/improvement of other Operators' similar processes. In particular, this approach is now being adopted by BP.\nThe good cooperation with BP, Shell and Mærsk has also aided post drilling campaign relations which enables better knowledge about continued rig operations / problems / challenges, and gives possibilities for some influence before picking up the rig later.\nFor more details on key learning from the ACD process, reference is made to NCAS report #1997 S 2405.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\25745new.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02.\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.1.8\nLogistic\n3.1.8.1 Shore Base\nNCAS used the Aker Base AS shorebase facilities at Dusavik as the supply base. These facilities, both quays, warehouses and yard are just adjacent to NCAS' offices. This made it easy for NCAS logistics personnel to supervise and control the activities connected to transportation and materials movement. The facilities, equipment and personnel resources available at the base were adequate and functioned satisfactorily throughout the well.\n3.1.8.2\nVessel Support\nNCAS chartered the MN Guard Valiant to provide standby duties. This vessel was chartered jointly with BP. The vessel was inspected by a third party and approved by NCAS and BP while in shipyard before commencement of contract. The vessel took up duty for BP at Mærsk Jutlander immediately after inspection and NCAS continued the use of this vessel. The Guard Valiant was therefore familiar with the rig, rig crew and procedures.\nIn an effort to reduce supply vessel cost, NCAS went into a vessel sharing agreement with Elf. Elf operates out of Dusavik and has regular sailing's to Frigg and Heimdal. NCAS got two scheduled sailing's per week and the use of spare vessel capacity when it was available/required. For this arrangement, NCAS was charged with an all-inclusive dayrate, five (5) days a week, for the duration of the well. The agreement was in effect for 25 days. During the well, this arrangement worked very well and NCAS did not experience any operational difficulties because of this arrangement. NCAS had 14 sailing's during the well; 10 scheduled and 4 ad-hocs with Statoil and Esso shared vessels. Boat costs were only about 10% of what the cost would have been without boat sharing.\nA separate, lesson learned report about this vessel sharing will be prepared by MSP following the third well.\nWhen mobilizing, the rig and two anchor handlers were taken over from BP after the rig was under tight tow. After completion of drilling operations at well 25/7-4S, two anchor handlers were spot chartered to mobilize the rig to the new location at 650717-11S.\n3.1.8.3 Helicopter Support 25/7-4S\nPersonnel were transported to the Maersk Jutlander from Stavanger Heliport, Sola. Helikopter Service A/S was contracted through Statoil to primarily fly Super Puma AS332L/L2's three times per week for crew changes. NCAS also bought capacity on flights contracted to Elf and Esso in addition to selling available capacity on our flights to Statoil when possible. Roundtrips to the 25/7-4S location had a duration of approximately 2 hours. The first flight to the MJ was completed out of Bergen on\nG:\\GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nMay 29. The last flight was completed out of Stavanger on June 20. A total of 349 persons (169 mobilized, 180 de-mobilized) were moved on a total of 17 flights, of which, 9 flights were scheduled, 6 were ad-hocs and capacity on 2 flights was bought from other Operators.\nThe booking of personnel was done by Statoil using the Statoil personnel tracking system, SPT.\nSavings were approximately 30% based on planned budget details.\n3.2 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED\n3.2.1 Mobilize rig\nA. Objectives\n•\nMove rig safely. Perform simultaneous activities picking up equipment etc. optimize start-up. Mobilize positioning equipment prior to starting rig move.\n•\nB. Results\nPlanned moving time: 72 hours Actual moving time: 55 hours\nThe Mærsk Jutlander (MJ) was on contract to Conoco at 1230 hours on 28/05/97 when the rig was under tight tow near BP's 6407/8-3 location offshore Mid-Norway. The M/V “ Bonevista”, a 10,880 HP AHV, was used to move the MJ to the 25/7-4S location with an overall average speed of 6.38 Knots/hour. No casing or pipe handling activities were performed outside the critical path due to poor (high VCG) vessel motion characteristics, and restrictions from the contractor (reference anchor report details in Section 3.3.7).\nC. Observations and Lessons Learned\nThe mobilization to 25/7-4S was quicker than estimated due to the following reasons: • Rig's thrusters were used to increase tow speed. • The rig was de-ballasted and was in a high position. • Good weather and sea conditions allowed for a fast towing speed with\nminimal vessel motion.\nD. The Mærsk Jutlander has very stringent limitations concerning the amount of\ncargo that can be on the rig during transient conditions, and also, movement of the\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR\\25-7-45\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\ntraveling block and cranes while at towing draft, during ballasting or de-ballasting operations. Due to these reasons, no tasks were accomplished outside the critical path. Future wells drilled with this unit should not include planned simultaneous activities during ballasting, de-ballasting and moving unless a stability evaluation is performed and a mutual understanding can be agreed with the drilling contractor.\n3.2.2 Pre-Spud Operations\nA. Objectives • Position rig within 5m of intended surface location. This was critical due to\nthe position of the drilling location which is in a narrow corridor between the License boundary and the Heimdal pipeline. Maintain close control of anchor position in relation to the Heimdal pipeline that is adjacent to the mooring spread (to the west). Prepare for an expeditious spud by conducting drilling operations simultaneous to marine operations.\nB. Results\nPlanned time: 24.0 hours Actual time: 28.5 hours\nUpon arrival on location, the M/V “Normand Trym” & M/V “ Bonevista” set eight (8) anchors. Anchors # 1, 2, 3 and 4 were set at the 200m minimal distance from the Heimdal pipeline. The 15 MT Stevin rig anchors on mooring # 2 and # 3 were replaced upon arrival at the 25/7-4S location, with 15 MT Stevpris anchors in order to increase the holding power at the reduced radius of -730m.\nThe final heading of the rig was 178.9° and the anchors were laid in the following pattern:\nANCHOR #\nBEARING\nLENGTH OF CHAIN FROM FAIRLEADER\noo vau AWNA\n205 deg. 227 deg. 310 deg. 330 deg. 020 deg. 065 deg. 110 deg 156 deg.\n1134 m 689 m 666 m 1142 m 1151 m 1168 m 1189 m 1174 m\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nThe rig was de-ballasted and the anchors were pre-tensioned to 160 MT and the rig moved to its final position, with well coordinates 2.7m from the intended position. All anchors held and no “piggy back” anchors were required although anchor # 2 slipped, it required soaking and then re-testing.\nDrill string and BHA were picked up and the 30” casing was run and hung off before RIH to spud the well.\nC. Observations and Lessons Learned\n•\nOperations were slow to commence because it was not possible to start drilling related tasks until the rig had fully de-ballasted.\n• More drill pipe than needed for top hole sections was picked up in order to\nspeed the operation after drilling had started.\nIt was necessary to change out the slip joint packer element. This repair consumed 5.5 hours. This activity should have been conducted outside of critical path by transporting the slip joint onshore. This was not done because problems with this piece of equipment were not communicated in time to allow transport prior to leaving the previous location.\n3.2.3\nDrill 36” Hole\nA. Objectives\n•\nDrill +71 m below the mudline to set 30\" conductor.\n• Maintain verticality of the wellbore.\nB. Results\nPlanned Time: Actual Time:\n12.0 hours 38.0 hours\nThe Actual time was significantly longer than the planned time due to spending 25.5 hrs on handling of drill string and BHA components. This was necessary because rig stability did not permit any of these activities to be conducted outside of critical path. Much more pipe was picked up than was required for surface hole, this allowed quicker operations on subsequent sections.\nThe 36” hole was drilled in 7.0 hours at an ROP of 11.7 m/hr with a 9 1/2\" BHA, using a 17 12\" SS33S (IADC code 1-1-5) bit and a single stage 36” hole opener. The 36” hole was drilled to 226m (82.0m below the mudline), angle at 231m was\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-4812574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n0.5 deg.

It is estimated that this saved 4.0 hours of rig time.\n•\nThe Anderdrift Deviation measuring tool functioned well and saved time since is could be pre-assembled with the hole opener.\n3.2.4 Run and Cement 30” Casing\nA. Objectives\n•\nSet casing on bottom with 1.47-2.1m spacing between mudline and top of the 30\" housing (to allow the possibility for an abandonment structure to be installed).\n• Obtain good primary cement job with no need for a remedial cementing.\n•\nSet guidebase with < 1.5° angle.\nB. Results\nPlanned Time: 22.5 hours Actual Time: 14.5 hours\n•\nThe 30” housing was set 2.08 m above the mudline.\nThe cementing job was successful; no remedial jobs were required. The cement settled +/- 0.5 m. Cement returns to the seabed were observed with the ROV.\nThe guide base was set at zero degrees and remained the same throughout the operations.\nG: GROUP DRILLING\\FWR125-7-45\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nConoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nObservations and Lessons Learned\n•\nThe 30” was set on bottom with no problems.\n•\nTo ensure the guidebase would remain vertical, 5 hours were used in waiting on cement. This lengthy WOC should be minimized on future wells.\nFlorescene dye was pumped ahead of the cement slurry in an attempt to flag the cement returns for observation at the seabed: no dye was observed while cementing due to the cloudy ocean bottom conditions. The dye should be continued on future wells because with good seabed visibility it is a good fluid flag to mark returns.\nAll objects were operationally and safely met.\n3.2.5\nDrill 17 1/2\"' Hole\nA. Objectives\n• Maintain verticality of the wellbore.\nSafely drill through shallow section in a riser-less mode with no shallow gas incidents.\nB.\nResults\nPlanned Time: 56.0 hours Actual Time: 50.5 hours\nThe 17 12” section was drilled to 1,195m without any evidence of shallow gas in the interval. Well inclination built to a maximum of 2.0 degrees but this angle did not have an adverse effect on operations.\nObservations and Lessons Learned\n•\nA 26\" bit was not utilized to drill out the 30” shoe and rathole, instead a 17 1/2\" bit and BHA was used. TOC was found at 210m, (24/2m high) and the bit was used to ream through the shoe several times before drilling ahead. Eliminating the 26” bit run did not cause any problems due to rubble or cement falling in from the rathole section and this saved an estimated 12-14 hours of rig time.\nData from the offset wells and the site survey gave no indications of shallow gas. Thus the 17 1/2\" section was planned and executed without drilling a pilot hole. This saved an estimated 24 hours in rig time.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR\\25-7-45\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 2577-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n•\nThe section was drilled with seawater using 30 bbl “high vis” sweeps on each single and spotting 50 bbl “high vis” pills on each stand connection.\nA new 17 1/2\" SS33S (IADC, Code 1-1-5) was used in this hole section and drilled at an average 32.1 m/hr. The ROP and the grading of the bit indicated that this type bit is ideal for drilling this section.\n•\nThe angle gradually increased to a maximum of 2.0° at 1,068m and decreased to 1.8' at 1,185m which was the last survey before casing point.\nThe hole remained stable during the drilling operation. It was elected to pump out of the hole instead of POOH to run casing. It is not necessary to pump out of hole on future wells unless there are hole problems.\n•\nThere were no bubbles observed around the wellhead area while drilling\nAccelerometers on the MWD indicated high axial vibrations during surface hole drilling. Surface parameters should be monitored and drillers should be instructed to change parameters if rough (high vibration) drilling is encountered.\nAll objects were operationally and safely met.\n3.2.6 Run and Cement 13 3/8” Casing\nA.\nObjectives\n• Run casing without incident of stuck pipe.\n•\nObtain a competent shoe to allow drilling the well to TD.\n•\nCirculate cement to mudline to cover any potential gas zones and to ensure good structural support.\nB.\nResults\nPlanned Time: 24.0 hours Actual Time: 25.5 hours\nThe casing was run, set and cemented at 1,188 m without problem or incidents.\nG:\\GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-48\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nC.\nObservations and Lessons Learned\nThe casing was run without any significant problems. It was necessary to wash through a tight spot at 1,056 m. Casing went to bottom and the 18 34\" wellhead housing was latched into the 30” housing\nTwo hours of lost time were caused by problems with the “Light Eagle” tubular handling system. Most problems were caused by operator inexperience with the “Light Eagle” pipe handling system. Drilling contractors need to give their hands additional on-the-job training in order to prevent similar mishaps and downtime.\nA florescene dye was pumped ahead of the cement slurry. The dye was not observed nor were cement returns to the seabed seen by the ROV due to cloudy ocean bottom conditions. Use of the dye should continue on future wells because when visibility is good it is a benefit for identifying cement returns.\n•\nA LOT of 1.90 sg EMW was achieved below the casing shoe.\nThe Dowell-Schlumberger Subsea Express plug system functioned properly giving good surface pressure indications. The plug system was installed in the wellhead joint prior to shipping offshore. Good QA on the pre-assembly process is critical, therefore a Conoco representative was present during pre-assembly. No problems occurred and this worked well.\nThe Cement plug was not “bumped” using the rig pumps even though fifty percent of the shoe track was displaced. TOC was tagged at 1,150m which is 12 m above the shoe. It is suggested to spot caliper and check the internal diameter of the casing and compare with the manufacturers internal diameter. Consider going lower on the efficiency of the pumps (say 95%). Ensure the drilling contractor has a good measurement of his pump efficiency.\nAll objects were operationally and safely met.\nG:\\GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.2.7\nRun BOP and Riser\nA.

Good quality GR/Res. data was acquired through the entire section. All objectives were achieved but with 25.75 hours of problems as discussed below:\n- 17 12 hours trip due to a loss of pump pressure, and resulting trip which\nincluded changing out the GR MWD tool. - 7 1/2 hours conditioning mud. - 3/4 hours repair mud pump stroke counter.\nC.\nObservations and Lessons Learned\nThe MWD was changed out prior to this hole section due to high axial vibration shocks in the surface hole which were recorded by MWD accelerometers. Drilling parameters should be monitored and changed immediately if significant sting vibration occur.\nA steerable drilling assembly with a 9 5/8” A962M PowerPak with a 1.0° bent housing was used (0.2 Revs/gallon). This system performed well.\nThe well was kicked off at 1252m and hole angle was increased to 8.4 deg. at 1,497m. The azimuth of the well at this point was 326 deg. A decision was made that it would be unnecessary to drop the well angle before entering the target. The well was rotated from 1,497m to the casing point at 1940m. The well had an azimuth of 325 deg. and 8.9 degree angle at casing point.\nCritical path time was required for downloading MWD data. It should be evaluated with the MWD contractor to determine if the data can be downloaded in the derrick or on the pipe rack, therefore outside of the critical path.\nThe BHA proved to be an almost perfect holding assembly in the rotary mode.\nAfter drilling out 13 3/8” and taking a LOT several problems were encountered. A total of 25.75 hours were lost.\n- 17 12 hours trip due to a loss, and resulting trip which included\nchanging out the GR MWD tool. - 7 1/2 hours conditioning mud. - 34 hours repair mud pump stroke counter.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-49 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\nWhile drilling from 1195m - 1219m, a pressure drop of 600 – 700 psi was observed: 9 hours were lost tripping and no washout was found. It was later noted that 6 1/2 sacks of EZ-mud had been added to the system just prior to the observed pressure loss. The following day a 500 psi pressure loss was noted after adding two sacks of EZ-mud. Simultaneous to these pressure problems, MWD problems occurred and no GR signals where being transmitted. The GR tool was changed out during the trip looking for the washout.\nAfter tripping back in the hole it was not possible to circulate at full rate; i.e. losing mud over the shaker at 15-25 SPM (8.5 hours loss circulating). The system had been treated with a high polymer concentration in anticipation of high ROP. Instead of drilling ahead, a trip was made due to pressure loss and the MWD failure. The viscosity of the mud increased drastically during the trip. After the trip, drilling continued to 1298 but with slow ROP (1-2 m/hr). Several KCl brine pills plus a mud/Condet pill were pumped to clean the bit. Water was added to the system and the mud weight was dropped from 1.45 to 1.32 sg. Gradually the ROP increased 10-50 m/hr.\n•\nWhen the bit was pulled at the casing point, six (6) nozzles were plugged, two with rubber.\nDiscussion Regarding Mud Problems:\n• EZ MUD DP was added too rapidly, it appears that the 600-700 psi\npressure drop was due to EZ mud additions which acted as a friction reducer.\nPolymer concentrations were too high causing high viscosity and inadequate freewater in the mud system.\nBarasilc mud (very high ph) was used on the previous well and it is possible that residue of this material in the brine tanks caused some contamination to the system.\nPolymer in the mud was not properly sheared.\nIt is also noted that the booster pump was shut down at approximately the same time as the pressure loss, this may have caused lower pump efficiency and contributed to the pressure loss.\nG:\\GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR\\25-7-43\\2574Snew.doc\nFile code: 25/7-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 01.12.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-4S\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n3.2.9 Run and Cement 9 5/8” Casing\nA.\nObjectives\n•\nRun casing without incident of stuck pipe.\n•\nObtain a competent casing shoe, to allow drilling well to TD.\nB.\nResults\nPlanned Time: 71.0 hours Actual Time: 52.5 hours\nThe 9 5/8” casing was run to a shoe depth of 1,931m and cemented. The plug was bumped and the float equipment allowed zero backflow. A LOT was performed to give an EMW of 1.59 sg. All objectives were achieved.\nObservations and Lessons Learned\n•\nCirculated prior to cementing and noted some loss of returns at 140 SPM, no losses at 80 SPM. Total of 80 bbls lost during circulating and cementing\nCasing centralizes were pre-installed and the casing was drifted, threads cleaned and pre-doped onshore. This should be continue as it saves time.\nThe Dowell “VIP” mixing unit worked well and provided a good consistent slurry.\nCement job was displaced with 1.2 sg mud (MW to be used in next hole section) to eliminate mico-annulus due to reducing the MW after the cement is set.\n3.2.10 Drill 81/2\" Hole to Core Point\nA.\nObjectives\n•\nSafely drill to coring point, in Hermod Formation based on LWD data.\n•\nObtain good quality LWD and survey data.\n•\nDrill a gauge hole.\nG: GROUP\\DRILLING\\FWR125-7-4S12574Snew.doc\nFile code: 2517-45 B2.60 Rev.: 02\nDate: 28.11.97\nconoco\nFINAL WELL REPORT WELL 25/7-45\nSection: 3\nDRILLING OPERATIONS\n• •\nEnsure wellbore stays inside target boundaries.

Due to high viscosity mud, rig time was spent trying to condition the mud. This was probably the result of one or a combination of the following: 1). Polymer concentration in the mud was too high. 2). Brine which was added from the brine tank had a very high pH due to silicate residue that remained in the tank from the sodium silicate system on the previous well. 3). Inadequate shearing of polymers prior to displacement.\nOn future wells, the initial mud make up should contain a minimum of polymers to avoid viscosity problems after the displacement. A better quality control of the bulk brine deliveries to the rig must be done, to allow for a better understanding of the bulk brine tank contents. The high viscosity mud led to bit balling and thereby slow ROP. Achieving a better fluids hydraulics initially, will solve this problem. A shaker screen inventory with a wider range of sizes would be much beneficial on future wells.\nThe total mud cost for this well came to: 1,017,334.26 NOK. This is not to compare with the invoice, since brine losses on the boat is not accounted for on the rig, and engineering cost is not in the mud cost. The programmed cost for this well was 1,257,401.00 NOK. The smaller actual figure is due to less consumption of polymers than planned, especially the PHPA.\n25-07-9 BAROID a Division of Baroid Corp\nCompany:\nNorske Conoco A/S\nCountry:\nNORWAY\nWell Name:\n25/7-4 S\nGeo Area:\nNORTH SEA\nMaersk\nField:\nContractor: Rig:\n25/7 Offshore\nMaersk Jutlander\nRegion:\nInterval Discussion\nInterval # 01\n36\" in.

A casing shoe at approximately 1200 m will allow adequate mud weight to maintain riser margin, kick tolerance and wellbore stability for drilling the upper Tertiary interval.\nSummary : This section was drilled from 231 to 1195 m with returns to seabed. A 30 bbl hi-vis bentonite sweep was pumped every joint drilled and a 50 bbl on every connection. Prior to running the 13 3/8\" casing the open hole was displaced to 1.20 SG hi-vis bentonite mud. The string was pumped out to the shoe with no drag being observed and the planned wiper trip was aborted and the string pulled out of the hole. The 13 3/8\" casing was run and cemented as per programme with the shoe set at 1186.5 m.

Hole Section 12 1/4\" SECTION\nObjective: To case off all of the reactive Hordaland shales to allow adequate kick tolerance to drill to TD in the 8 1/2\"hole. To isolate higher pressured and unstable intervals in the tertiary. Allow a mud weight reduction and improve the chances for successful data acquisition in the 8 1/2\" hole.\nSummary : The cement was drilled with seawater down to 1 m above the shoe to 1187 m. The hole was then displaced to 1.45 SG KCL/Glycol/Gem mud. The shoe was drilled out and 3 m of new formation down to 1198 m was drilled prior to performing a leak off test to 1.90 SG equivalent mud weight. At 1219 m a 700 psi pressure drop was observed and checks on surface equipment and a subsequent trip did not reveal any leaks or a possible wash out. When back on bottom a circulation rate of only 15-25 strokes could be established without losing mud on the shakers. The shaker screens were removed and the strokes were increased to 210 in an attempt to shear and heat the mud. After several hours at this circulation rate the strokes were reduced to 105 and all screens were re-installed and the circulation rate was gradually increased to 200 strokes/minute and drilling commenced. Prior to the 700 psi pressure loss 6 sacks of EZ MUD DP were added to the active at 30 minutes/sack. It is common to see a pressure drop of 100-200 psi after having added EZ MUD DP, but not as high as 700 psi. Also the PH of the active mud had a higher value than normal for this mud system and a possible explanation for this could be Barasilc contamination in the brine tank from the previous well. A possible solution to avoid similar circulation problems in the future will be to make sure that initial concentration of polymers is low. Polymers regulating filter loss, PHPA and to a certain degree viscosity, can be added after full circulation rate has been established and the PH of the system has fallen to an acceptable level and the cement has been drilled out. It is also adviceable to have a shear gun installed in the pit and thus be able to pre shear the mud prior to displacement. At 1260 m a 500 psi pressure loss was observed. As all surface equipment was found to be OK drilling commenced when pressure returned to normal after a short while of circulation. When penetration rates slowly decreased to 1-2 m/hr bit balling was thought to be the most likely explanation. A few 50 bbl KCL brine/drillwater pills together with a mud/Condet pill was pumped in an attempt to combat the problem with no apparent success. It was decided to lower the mud weight to 1.32 SG and reduce the polymer concentration by dilution, resulting in a higher penetration rate. The mud weight was again increased to 1.45 SG without affecting the penetration rates and the section was drilled to TD of 1940 m without further incidents. When pulling out of the hole an overpull of 25/50 kibs was observed between 1540 and 1520 m. The 9 5/8\" casing was run to 1931 m and cemented as per programme. The cement was displaced with 1.20 SG mud being used on the 8 1/2\" section.\n25-07-9 BAROID a Division of Baroid Corp\nNorske Conoco A/S\nCountry:\nNORWAY NORTH SEA\n25/7-4 S\nGeo Area:\nCompany: Well Name: Contractor: Rig:\nMaersk\n25/7\nField: Region:\nMaersk Jutlander\nOffshore\nInterval Discussion Interval # 03 12.25 in. Hole Section\nDensity : The section was drilled out with 1.45 SG mud. At 1260 m the weight was lowered to 1.32 SG and increased to 1.45 SG at 1700 m and kept at this level to the end of the section.\nRheology and hole cleaning : Prior to diluting the system to lower the mud weight and rheology, the rheology was well above the specification due to excess polymers. After dilution a more normal viscosity profile for KCL/Glycol mud was obtained and the hole cleaning ability of the system was never a concern in this near vertical well which the excellent state of the cuttings proved.\nMud properties : Initially viscosity was very high due to excess polymers in the system. This was treated with high dilution rates. The PH was high due to cement contamination and possibly due to brine contamination. The pH was reduced with citric acid to preserve the polymers.\nSolids control : Initially all Swaco shakers were dressed with 84 mesh screens. After the mud had heated up and had been sheared, two shakers were changed to 110 mesh screens. Very little drill solids were produced if the nature of the cutting was anything to go by and hence insignificant volumes of drill solids build up was observed.\nVariances from mud program :Apart from reducing and increasing the mud weight and slightly modifying the rheology figures(lowering)after dilution, the section was drilled as programmed.\n25-07.9 BAROID a Division of Baroid Corp\nNorske Conoco A/S\nCountry:\nCompany: Well Name: Contractor:\nNORWAY NORTH SEA\n25/7-4 S\nMaersk\nGeo Area: Field: Region:\n25/7\nRig:\nMaersk Jutlander\nOffshore\nInterval Discussion\nInterval # 04\n8.5 in. Hole Section\n8 1/2\" SECTION\nObjective: To evaluate the Hermod reservoir sands and drill\nadequate Cretaceous interval to log the Top Cretaceous.\nSummary : The cement, float and shoe track was drilled out with 1.20 SG KCL/Glycol/Gem mud and 3 m of new formation was drilled down to 1943 m. A leak off test was performed to 1.60 SG equivalent mud weight. Drilling then proceeded through the Balder and the Sele formations into the Hermod sandstone. The Hermod was expected to be a normally pressured sandstone at approximately 1.03 S.G. No hydrocarbon shows were experienced in this interval and the drilling proceeded into the Cretaceous formation with a trip being made at 2538 metres due to wash out in the drillpipe. The interval was finally drilled to TD at 2560 metres. No excessive drag was experienced when pulling out of the hole, hence no wiper trip or back reaming was required. No mud related problems were experienced on this interval and the mud system in use performed very satisfactory. The hole was logged and finally plugged and abandoned according to normal procedure. Density : The initial mud weight was 1.20 S.G. and the maximum weight was recorded to 1.22 S.G. No indication of inadequate mud density was experienced throughout this interval.\nRheology and hole cleaning :The low end rheology was slightly lower than recommended; however no indication on poor hole cleaning were experienced throughout the interval.\nMud properties : Due to the potential of stuck pipe in this interval, the API filtrate was reduced to under 2.5 ml. This low fluid loss together with a low concentration of drill solids in the mud at any time, produced a thin, slick filter cake. The MBT was easily controlled below 5 me/ml with only minimum dilutions being made.\nSolids control : The four Swaco ALS shakers in use were initially dressed with 2 x 110 mesh and 2 x 140 mesh screens.
