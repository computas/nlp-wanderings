Well 25/4-10 S proved a minor oil discovery in Hermod Formation injection sands. The objective of the sidetrack was to test the South Kneler prospect in Heimdal Formation turbidite fans between the Kneler oil field to the north, and the Gekko gas discovery to the east. Operations and results Wildcat well 25/4-10 A was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Winner. It was kicked off from 816 m in the primary well on 11 November 2009 and drilled to TD at 2550 m (2193 m TVD) in the Paleocene Heimdal Formation. The well was drilled with Versatec OBM from kick-off to TD.The Sele Formation came in at 2323m (1993 m TVD) and the Heimdal Formation at 2476 m (2108 m TVD). The sidetrack well encountered gas in two sandstone layers which were six metres thick in total in the Lista Formation. The reservoir rock was significantly thinner than expected. Oil shows in the well, if any, were masked by the oil based mud.No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.The well was permanently abandoned on 28 November 2009 as a minor gas discovery. Testing No drill stem test was performed."}
